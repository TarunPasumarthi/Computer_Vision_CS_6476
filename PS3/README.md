# CS 6476 project 3: [Local Feature Matching](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/compvision/proj2/)


# Setup
- Install <a href="https://conda.io/miniconda.html">Miniconda</a> (pyhon 3.6).
- Create a conda environment, using the appropriate command. On Windows, open the installed "Conda prompt" to run this command. On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command. Modify the command based on your OS ('linux', 'mac', or 'win'): `conda env create -f proj3_env_<OS>.yml`
- This should create an environment named `proj3`. Activate it using the following Windows command: `activate proj3` or the following MacOS / Linux command: `conda activate proj3`.
- Run the notebook using: `jupyter notebook ./proj3_code/proj3.ipynb`
- Generate the submission once you're finished using `python zip_submission.py`
